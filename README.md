### Who am I?
> I'm currently trying to learn Github and learn how to use Python and SQL as a data scientist  
`I got this`
> `git status`  
### These are the goals that I have set for myself that I need to accomplish:
- [ ] Week 1–4: Foundations of Python and SQL  
Goal: Build foundational knowledge of Python and SQL while learning how to manipulate data.
Python (6–8 hours/week)  
  - [ ] Week 1: Python Basics  
    - [ ] Variables  
    - [ ] Data types
    - [ ] Control structures (if-else, loops)  
    - [ ] Functions  
  - [ ] Practice: Write scripts to calculate metrics like averages or filter datasets.  
Tools: Google Colab  

  - [ ] Week 1: SQL Basics  
    - [ ] SELECT
    - [ ] FROM
    - [ ] WHERE
    - [ ] ORDER BY
    - [ ] DISTINCT  
  - [ ] Practice: Simple queries to filter and sort data (use SQLZoo or Mode Analytics).


Week 2: Data Structures and Libraries
Topics: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples.
Intro to NumPy: Arrays, array operations.
Practice: Create Python scripts to analyze and process small datasets.
Week 3: Introduction to Pandas
Topics: DataFrames, basic operations (selecting rows/columns, filtering, grouping).
Practice: Load and analyze a simple dataset (e.g., sales or employee data).
Week 4: Data Visualization
Topics: Matplotlib and Seaborn basics (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots).
Practice: Visualize trends in sample datasets.

SQL (4–6 hours/week)
Week 1: SQL Basics
Topics: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT.
Practice: Simple queries to filter and sort data (use SQLZoo or Mode Analytics).
Week 2: Aggregate Functions
Topics: COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY.
Practice: Analyze datasets to find metrics like total sales or average salary.
Week 3: Joins and Relationships
Topics: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN.
Practice: Combine data from multiple tables (e.g., sales and customer data).
Week 4: Subqueries and Filtering
Topics: Subqueries, HAVING, complex WHERE conditions.
Practice: Write queries to extract specific subsets of data.

Week 5–8: Intermediate Analysis and Real-World Applications
Goal: Learn intermediate data analysis techniques and start working on real-world datasets.
Python (6–8 hours/week)
Week 5: Data Cleaning with Pandas
Topics: Handling missing values, data transformation, renaming columns.
Practice: Clean a messy dataset (e.g., customer or sales data).
Week 6: Advanced Data Manipulation
Topics: Merging datasets, advanced groupby operations.
Practice: Combine multiple datasets and calculate advanced metrics.
Week 7: Advanced Visualization with Seaborn
Topics: Heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots.
Practice: Create detailed visualizations to analyze correlations.
Week 8: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
Topics: Scikit-learn basics, linear regression, decision trees.
Practice: Build a simple predictive model (e.g., predicting sales based on past data).

SQL (4–6 hours/week)
Week 5: Advanced Joins
Topics: FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN.
Practice: Analyze multi-table datasets (e.g., inventory and supplier data).
Week 6: Window Functions
Topics: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY.
Practice: Generate rankings or running totals.
Week 7: Indexing and Query Optimization
Topics: Query optimization techniques, indexing.
Practice: Optimize complex queries for speed.
Week 8: Stored Procedures and Views
Topics: Create reusable queries using views and stored procedures.
Practice: Create a view for commonly used queries (e.g., monthly sales trends).

Week 9–12: Advanced Topics and Integration
Goal: Master advanced data analysis and machine learning, and integrate Python and SQL for real-world projects.
Python (8–10 hours/week)
Week 9: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Topics: Identifying trends, outliers, and patterns.
Practice: Perform EDA on a large dataset (e.g., Kaggle’s Titanic dataset).
Week 10: Advanced Machine Learning
Topics: Classification (logistic regression), clustering (k-means).
Practice: Build a classification model for a business use case.
Week 11: Automation with Python
Topics: Automating data pipelines, working with APIs.
Practice: Write a script to extract data from an API and process it.
Week 12: Final Project in Python
Project: Analyze a business dataset, build predictive models, and generate a report with visualizations.

SQL (4–6 hours/week)
Week 9: Python + SQL Integration
Topics: Using Python libraries like sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy.
Practice: Query a database and analyze the data using Pandas.
Week 10: Advanced Querying
Topics: Recursive queries, common table expressions (CTEs).
Practice: Solve complex SQL problems.
Week 11: Reporting with SQL
Topics: Generating reports for business scenarios.
Practice: Write SQL scripts to create a business dashboard.
Week 12: Final SQL Project
Project: Use a sample database to write queries and create business insights (e.g., customer segmentation, sales trends).

Deliverables
Python Portfolio:
Scripts for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
Final Python project showcasing end-to-end analysis.
SQL Portfolio:
A collection of optimized SQL queries for various business scenarios.
Final SQL project with detailed queries and insights.
Integrated Python + SQL Project:
A project where Python is used to query a SQL database, process data, and generate reports or visualizations.
